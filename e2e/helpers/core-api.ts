 * The ids of the seeded group invitations, keyed by their seed note (S-023).

 * **The only fixture in this suite fetched from core-api rather than found in the app**, and
 * deliberately so: an invitation id reaches its recipient out of band -- in an email, or pasted
 * into a chat -- so there is no screen a *recipient* could read it from.
 *
 * T-018 built the minting side, and the S-023 row expected that to retire this helper. It does
 * not, quite: two of the five seeded fixtures are on groups whose settings tab shows no invitation
 * section at all -- an organizational group cannot be joined, so the section is hidden there, and
 * so the only way to a link on one is this. What T-018 did change is that the *ordinary* case is
 * now clickable, which is what `group-invitations.spec.ts`'s management test exercises.
 *
 * Called once per spec file (`test.beforeAll`), not per test -- core-api's login is bcrypt-slow,
 * which is the same reason `loginAndGetCookie` is called once per persona.
